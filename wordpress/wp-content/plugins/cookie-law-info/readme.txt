Easily set up cookie notice and get GDPR Cookie Consent as per EU GDPR/Cookie Law regulations. The plugin supports GDPR (DSGVO, RGPD), LGPD, CCPA Do Not Sell, and CNIL of France.

GDPR CookieConsent' plugin is getting renamed as ‘CookieYes - GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice' plugin. WebToffee will continue to develop and maintain this plugin. In addition to the current features, we have integrated a free Automatic Cookie Scan service into the plugin. You need an account with CookieYes in order to use the scan service, but no worries, we will automatically create an account for you when you initiate the scan.

== Description ==

The CookieYes GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice plugin will assist you in making your website GDPR (RGPD, DSVGO) compliant. In addition to compliance with this GDPR WordPress plugin also supports cookie compliance in accordance with the LGPD of Brazil, CNIL of France, and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.

The plugin is one of the best WordPress GDPR compliance plugins as it comes with a host of features some of which are listed below.

== Key Features == 

- The plugin will enable a WordPress cookie notice with Accept and Reject options. The cookies are not rendered by default and only upon user consent. (The cookie value will be set to ‘null’ by default; it takes a value 'yes' when the user clicks ‘Accept’ and ‘no’ upon 'Reject'. Your developer can check this value to set a cookie accordingly.)

- The plugin allows single click automatic scanning and categorization of cookies.

- Lets you display the list of cookies on your cookie policy page by using a shortcode.

- This GDPR plugin adds a subtle cookie banner to your WordPress website either in the header or footer so you can show your compliance status regarding the new GDPR law.

- With the help of this WordPress GDPR plugin, you can fully customise the cookie notice style so it blends with your existing website: change the colours, fonts, styles, the position on the page and even how it behaves when you click “Accept”.

- You can choose to make the cookie notice bar disappear after a few seconds (completely configurable) or to accept on scroll (an option available under Italian law).

- It also has a Cookie Audit module so you can easily show what cookies your site uses and display them neatly in a table on your Privacy & Cookies Policy page.

- The plugin can be configured to have a CCPA 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information' control to the cookie notice.

- Assists in compliance with CNIL - A french administrative regulatory body

- Integrates seamlessly with Official Facebook Pixel, Smash Balloon Instagram Feed & Twitter Feed.


== Additional Features == 

* Fully customisable to look just like your own website’s style: customise the colours, styles and fonts
* Put the cookie bar in either the header or the footer
* (Optional) accept cookie policy if the user scrolls
* (Optional) automatically close the cookie notice bar after a delay (delay is configurable)
* (Optional) cookie banner can be permanently dismissed or accessible through a “show again” tab
* (Optional) “show again” tab is fully customisable including position shown on page and styles
* “Cookie Audit” shortcode to construct a nicely-styled ‘Privacy & Cookie Policy’
* WPML compatible
* qTranslate and Polylang support


== The CookieYes GDPR Cookie Consent and Compliance Notice Plugin Uses The Following Cookies ==

- viewed_cookie_policy – Is the primary cookie that records the user consent for the usage of the cookies upon ‘accept’ and ‘reject’. It doesn’t track any personal data and is set only upon user action(accept/reject).

- cookielawinfo-checkbox-necessary/cookielawinfo-checkbox-non-necessary – Records the default button state of the corresponding category. It works only in coordination with the primary cookie.

- CookieLawInfoConsent – Records the default button state of the corresponding category & the status of CCPA. It works only in coordination with the primary cookie.


Another best part of this GDPR compliance plugin is that it seamlessly integrates with and supports WPML and qTranslate so your translation needs are covered.

= NOTE: INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN ALONE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SITE GDPR COMPLIANT. SINCE EACH SITE USES DIFFERENT COOKIES, YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU HAVE THE NECESSARY CONFIGURATIONS IN PLACE WITH A SUPPORTING COOKIE NOTICE. = 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

There’s a lot of help available on the main plugin website. See the [FAQ](https://www.cookielawinfo.com/faq) on the main website and the [setup guide](https://www.webtoffee.com/gdpr-cookie-consent-plugin-basic-version-user-guide/) for GDPR cookie compliance.

= The cookie notice header isn’t displaying ? =
First check you have installed the plugin and have activated it in the plugins panel.
To check if it is switched on or not, go to ‘GDPR Cookie Consent > Cookie Law Settings’ and then enable the cookie law.

= The cookie notice header doesn’t work on my browser ? =
Please report a bug on the support forum. Be sure to include the following information:

* Your URL (I will need this in order to help you!)
* WordPress version e.g. 4.2.2 (found in bottom right hand corner of the dashboard)
* Browser e.g. FireFox, Chrome, IE
* Describe the problem

The more information you give, the quicker we can respond.

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin will:

1. Add a cookie banner to the top/bottom of all pages on your website, notifying the visitor that you have a clearly defined privacy and cookie policy.
2. Allow you to record which cookies your site uses, and:
3. Neatly display a list of these cookies (via a shortcode). You can put this list on your Privacy & Cookie Policy page, for example.

= Does this plugin block all cookies? =
No. This plugin restricts cookies by optionally loading the scripts. For this, you have to add all cookies using the Cookie List > Add new cookie feature. It is not currently technically possible to completely block all cookies on your WordPress website without first updating all plugins that use cookies in some way. That is beyond the scope of any single plugin.
A more realistic approach for WordPress website owners is to move the scripts that place cookies( for eg:, Google Analytics tracking code) to the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin(within non-necessary cookie category) and then allow visitors to control it by giving consent.


= Do visitors now have to accept/refuse cookies in order to use websites? =
No. Only the 'necessary' cookies will be loaded till the user gives consent. 

= Does this plugin stop cookies from being stored? =
We provide you the facility to add cookies and the corresponding scripts (This works if the cookies are placed when a script is added to the site header or footer as in the case of Google analytics, Hotjar etc.)based on category. In our premium version, visitors can reject the category of cookies they don't want to get installed. In such cases, all cookies in that category will be blocked for the user. In the free version, you can still block the scripts but doesn't have category level granularity.

But if another plugin adds scripts or places a cookie then we do not have any control. We have no way of knowing what plugins you use or how they work, so blocking/deleting cookies on a WordPress website/blog would possibly/probably break your site. Larger websites with huge budgets may well invest in such technology, but this plugin aims to help you provide a certain level of compliance without taking drastic action. 

= Does this plugin guarantee that I comply with this law? =
No.
As a generic plugin, there's no way we can know anything about your specific circumstances. It can be used as part of an overall plan of action to comply, but just installing it and doing nothing more does nothing to help you. In all cases, you need to assess your own website's use of cookies and decide an appropriate course of action. If you are looking for specialist legal advice relating to your website you should always consult a lawyer.
See http://cookielawinfo.com for more information on what is required.
